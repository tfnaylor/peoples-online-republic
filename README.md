## About Us

The Peoples Online Republic (POR) is a non-profit organization that might be described as a virtual/online country. Rather than holding physical territory (land, borders, etc.), the POR holds and collectively manages online properties, including a social media platform and other related online services.

POR members are referred to as Citizens and must accept and adhere to the POR [Organizing Principals](organizing-principals.md) in order to maintain citizenship. POR Citizens are able to vote on initiatives, policies and online platform features using a simple online, majority rules system.

POR citizens are united by their disgust and rejection of the current and evolving state of politics and societal norms, both in the United States and elsewhere. We seek to affect change and, where change is not possible, to relocate to physical countries that best align with our Organizing Principals.

The POR does not seek to subvert, overthrow or disobey the laws or customs of any physical country. Rather, we demand that our citizens conform to all reasonable local laws and ordinances and seek to change those that are unreasonable – according to our [Organizing Principals](organizing-principals.md) – through available peaceful, democratic processes.
