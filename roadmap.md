The POR will take form and appear as an online presence in rough phases, driven by user participation and concept validation steps. These phases are outlined as follows.

## Phase 1: Validation

During this phase a basic online presence will be created, consisting primarily of an information website. This site will explain the mission, Organizing Principles and other information related to the POR concept. The website will also allow a user to register as a Citizen and thereafter receive monthly progress reports via email.

During this phase there will be no fundraising or other significant outreach activities (owing primarily to the lack of funds). Certain organizational and planning activities will get underway, all in preparation for the end of this phase. It is not expected that the legal entity formation (non-profit) will begin during this phase.

The end of Phase 1 will be achieved when 10K Citizens have registered via the website.

## Phase 2: Rising

This phase will signal the official launch of the POR legal entity and the initiation of technology platform development activities. The basic governance and organizational structure will be ratified and decisions will be taken by a close committee of initial members.

At the beginning of this phase, and coinciding with the finalization of the legal entity (in the USA initially), fundraising activities will commence. This will include a donation mechanism available on the website as well as outreach to potential donors.

The end of Phase 2 will be achieved when a basic online platform with at least a bare minimum of features is available and the legal entity, bank accounts, etc. are resolved.

## Phase 3: Operating

The first major milestone of this phase will be marked by the presence of an online platform that enables Citizens to vote. This will enable all future progress and priorities. From this point forward the POR will be primarily Citizen-driven.

In some respects, Phase 3 will never end as the organization and platform will continue to evolve so long as there are Citizens.

## Phase 4: Globalization

In this phase – at this point only a concept/desire – the POR will establish offices in other physical countries.
