We hold that certain truths are self-evident and beyond debate. These are as follows.

1. Nationalism, populism and fascism are great evils and have no place in politics or in government.
2. Systemic racism exists and must be defeated.
3. Policing must be reformed to prioritize conflict resolution and community building over the application of physical force.
4. Any form of discrimination based on gender, sexual preference or orientation is abhorrent.
5. Public health must be available to all and guided by science, absent all political influence.
6. Capitalism is an effective and generally beneficial economic model but must be constrained to avoid radical inequality and exploitation.
7. Private gun ownership is ordinarily unnecessary and a societal liability but where allowed is a privilege rather than a right.
8. Individual opinions and viewpoints must be respected unless/until those viewpoints impinge on the rights or freedoms of others.
