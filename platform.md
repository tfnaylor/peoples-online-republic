# Technology Platform

As a virtual nation, the People's Online Republic has as its foundation a technology platform that allows our Citizens to communicate, cooperate and forward our cause overall. We will not depend on existing platforms such as FaceBook, Twitter, etc. as we cannot trust or rely upon them to not censor, advertise or otherwise interfere with our society or objectives.

The following sections will outline the basic technology platform components and services as initially envisioned. Of course these will grow, expand and evolve based on direct participation of our Citizens and not as a result of economic or other factors.

The technology platform services will be delivered via a mobile application and website (also mobile-enabled).

## Voting System

First and foremost amongst our technology components is our online voting system. Without this none of our other efforts can be realized. The voting system consists of two basic sub-components as follows:

- **Proposition Creation & Management**  
POR Citizens vote on propositions. A proposition is a written description of an initiative, change or enhancement associated with the technology platform itself or virtually any other POR activity. The platform will provide a service that allows any Citizen to create a proposition. Once created, citizens are free to comment on the proposition and to campaign for support. In order for a proposition to be made available for voting, it must reach a minimum level of initial support (exact criterion TBD).

- **Proposition Voting**  
Once a proposition has achieved the minimum required level of community support, it will be put up for a general vote. Each votable proposition will have a voting time window (initially 30 days). Propositions are passed by a simple majority and will be prioritized by the POR administration thereafter.

## Social Media Platform

POR Citizens will have access a private, secure social media experience modeled after existing services such as FaceBook and Twitter. This service will not be advertising-driven and, like all POR services, will evolve based on Citizen participation (see Voting System).

## Choosing Socially Responsible Business and Services

POR Citizens will be able to select products and services based on their standing as POR-approved businesses. Think here of Yelp or Angie's List where the available choices are owned by POR Citizens and are known to support the POR Organizing Principals.

Aside from the convenience, this platform service is powerful in that it affects change. If businesses want to benefit from POR Citizen customers, they must accept and maintain POR compliance (just like individual Citizens do).

## Employment Service

POR Citizens can locate jobs with employers that are also Citizens. Additionally, employers can find employees that are POR Citizens.

## Host Country/Region Compatibility Matrix

The POR platform will assess and continually update the status of countries and regions in terms of their relative compatibility with our [Organizing Principals](organizing-principals.md). Additionally, for countries or regions where the compatibility index is especially high, we will provide emigration information and guidance for individuals interested in relocation.
